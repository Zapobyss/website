    <p>In a nutshell, I made this core as an answer to popular metagame trends, such as Dragon Types and Physical attackers.</p>

    <h2>Info</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Mawile</strong> can check many Fairy type attackers with Iron Head such as Clefable and Sylveon. It has Play Rough for Dragon, Fighting and Dark types, Swords Dance for either setting up on predicted switches from the opponent or to offset the halved Attack from Will-o-Wisp and Sucker Punch for valuable priority. Having the highest Attack stat in the game lets Mega-Mawile act as a wallbreaker.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Uxie</strong> can be used as a Swiss Army knife to check a wide array of physical attackers, such as Mega-Kangaskhan, Garchomp, Dragonite, Aegislash, and many more. Since many of these Pokémon carry setup moves, Reflect will offset the incoming physical damage from them, and Foul Play will punish their attempts to set up with Dragon Dance or Swords Dance. Rocky Helmet and Endure are excellent for Mega-Kangaskhan, as it will lose 33% of its HP (1/6th for each hit) upon contact and can be used to survive a Parental Bond attack at low health. It's also great to break Focus Sashes or Multiscale. On the other hand, surviving Outrage with Endure can also give you a free switch-in as the opponent gets confused due to fatigue.</p>
    
    <h2>Synergy</h2>
    <p>Uxie's Levitate complements with Mawile's weakness to Ground attacks, such as Earthquake.</p>
    <p>Foul Play is resisted by Fighting and Fairy types. Mawile can easily take care of those Pokémon with Play Rough and Iron Head respectively, as well as Pokémon with Justified.</p>
    
    <h2>Threat list</h2>
    
    <p>Work in progress, stay tuned.</p>
